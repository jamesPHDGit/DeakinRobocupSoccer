Welcome to the Deakin 2015 code release repository, which is based on UNSW code release 2014 https://github.com/UNSWComputing/rUNSWift-2014-release

The directory structure is:

* **bin**:
    This is where any executables are stored, such as configuration scripts (build_setup, nao_sync)
* **image**:
    The contents of this directory are synced to the robot with nao_sync, put custom configuration files
    or libraries here. Python code that handles behaviour decision making exists here.
* **robot**:
    This is the source code for the Deakin 2015 binaries, including the core architecture. Once again the foundation code is from UNSW code release 2014.
* **utils**:
    This is the source code for any off-nao utilities, such as colour
    calibration or offline debugging utilities.
